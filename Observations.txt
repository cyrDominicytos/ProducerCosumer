=== Abdel OreKan === Operating Systems Assignment #3

Observations :
 -I noticed that to get the "Consumer waiting" behavior, it is better to increase the waiting time of the producer by (1-6) 
 or more, because with a waiting time of (1-5) seconds, the producer is too fast and we almost never get the case: "Consumer waiting".

Positive point : 
  -I learned how to share array between threads
  -I learned to work with the process in parallel

Time consuming:
 -I spent more than a day to build the best algorithm then I implemented the system in about 1h:30

Hint : To test my project, run the file Test.Java and check the result at the end of the file called result.txt which is at the root of the project.
